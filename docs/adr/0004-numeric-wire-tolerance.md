# ADR 0004 — Strict-encode, permissive-decode for BMM `Real` and `Integer`

- **Status:** Accepted, 2026-05-16.
- **Tracks:** REQ-046 (BMM primitive mapping), REQ-052 (canonical-JSON wire profile), STRAND-04 (cross-SDK parity).

## Context

The BMM-conformance spec ([`specs/bmm-conformance.md`](../../specs/bmm-conformance.md) § Primitive type mapping) pins:

- `Real` → Go `float64`.
- `Integer` → Go `int32`.
- "Mappings are **fixed**; alternative widenings are not permitted."

The canonical-JSON wire profile ([`specs/wire.md`](../../specs/wire.md) REQ-052) requires:

- "`DV_QUANTITY` magnitudes are emitted as JSON numbers, not strings, **unless the spec mandates otherwise** (some implementations have used strings to avoid float-precision loss; the SDK takes a position — see § Floating-point precision below)."
- "Numeric magnitudes are serialised as IEEE 754 double-precision JSON numbers. The SDK **MUST NOT** silently coerce a magnitude through `float32` or a similarly lossy intermediate."

The wire spec foresees that real producers exist that emit `"magnitude": "354"` (string) rather than `"magnitude": 354` (number). The vendored cassettes confirm this — `testkit/cassettes/canonical_json/BMI.json` carries `"magnitude": "354"` etc. The spec ENCODE side is settled (numbers only); the DECODE side has been implicit until now.

A permissive decoder is needed for SDK consumers to round-trip real-world CDR fixtures, but stricter encoders downstream (PHP SDK, third-party producers) MUST be able to assume the SDK emits numbers. Asymmetric tolerance is the standard Postel-style answer; it needs to be **explicit** so cross-SDK parity (REQ-080, REQ-081) is unambiguous.

## Decision

The SDK MUST adopt asymmetric numeric tolerance:

- **Encode (`MarshalJSON`):** every `Real`/`Integer` value is emitted as a JSON number per REQ-052. No quoted output, ever. This is the only permitted behaviour.
- **Decode (`UnmarshalJSON`):** every `Real`/`Integer` field accepts EITHER a JSON number OR a quoted decimal string. A quoted form decodes as if it were the corresponding number; a malformed string returns a typed error.

To carry the asymmetric decode tolerance the SDK introduces two **defined types** rather than direct aliases:

```go
package rm

type Real    float64
type Integer int32
```

Both types are emitted by the BMM generator wherever the BMM primitive `Real` / `Integer` appears. The underlying types match REQ-046 (`float64` / `int32`); REQ-046's "fixed mapping" rule is **satisfied** at the structural level. The named types exist solely so the SDK can attach the permissive `UnmarshalJSON`. Encoders rely on the inherited number-emit behaviour via the `MarshalJSON` returning `float64`/`int32` to `encoding/json`.

`primitiveGoType` in [`internal/bmmgen/primitives.go`](../../internal/bmmgen/primitives.go) is the authoritative mapping table; it points `Real` and `Integer` at the alias types `Real` and `Integer`.

### Out of scope for this ADR

- **`Integer64` / `Double`**: keep their direct alias (`int64` / `float64`) for now. No vendored cassette currently exercises quoted variants for these, and a precedent in PHP / CDR has not yet been observed. Promote them to defined types if and when a cassette demonstrates the need.
- **Other numeric primitives** (`Octet`, `Character`): not affected — they're not floating-point and openEHR producers do not quote them.
- **Validating numeric precision** beyond IEEE 754 (REQ-052): out of scope; an overflow on decode still surfaces via `strconv.ParseFloat` / `strconv.ParseInt` and is wrapped in a typed error.

## Consequences

- Vendored CDR cassettes round-trip cleanly through `canjson` (PROBE-030 across `BMI.json`, `body_weight.json`, `clinical_note.json`, `vital_signs.json`).
- Cross-SDK parity (REQ-081): the PHP SDK MUST adopt the same tolerance to keep cassette round-trip semantics identical. Without this ADR the two SDKs could disagree on whether `"magnitude": "354"` is a decode error.
- Consumers that need strict-number-only decode can wrap `canjson.Unmarshal` with a pre-pass that rejects quoted numerics, but the SDK itself does not offer a strict-decode mode in v1 — the loss of cassette interoperability outweighs the parity benefit at this stage.
- The generated `MarshalJSON` for every concrete RM type continues to emit numbers (no behaviour change on the encode side).
- Documentation: REQ-046 stays as written — its "fixed mapping" pertains to underlying type only. The Floating-point precision section of REQ-052 references this ADR for decode tolerance. The note that `primitiveGoType` emits the alias type name (not the raw primitive) is captured in [`specs/bmm-conformance.md`](../../specs/bmm-conformance.md) § Primitive type mapping.
